# credit-risk-classification
I didn't have much trouble with this assignment as it did refer to the modules pretty directly and went in a logical order. No outside source was referenced for code. It was interesting to see the level of prediction precision vary with the amount of data between the two labeles. Natural to see the recall accuracy increase with the oversampled data as compared to the imbalanced data.
